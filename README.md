*Please note that the name is not an actual live site at the moment.* 

Portions of the project were written by Max the instructor of the site. However, a majority of the code was written following the course lessons. Each file written by me will 
contain my name at the top in comments. 

A social network project built following Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's MERN Fullstack Course

As a User, you may upload photos of different sights and places you've taken. You may then share these on your profile and view other people's places that they have uploaded creating a "Sight-Seeing" experience! 

The project is built using the MERN stack.
